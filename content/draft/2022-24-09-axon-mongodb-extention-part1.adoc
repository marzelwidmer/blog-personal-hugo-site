In this blog post we look into [Axon Framework](https://www.axoniq.io) is a framework for building evolutionary, event-driven microservice systems, based on the principles of Domain Driven Design, Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing.

We will disable the Axon Server and replaced it with the [MongoDB extension](https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-mongo) this extension provides functionality to leverage Mongo as an EventStorageEngine (to be used by an EventStore) and TokenStore.

For more information on anything Axon, please visit our website, [Axon Framework](https://www.axoniq.io).

= Commands / Events and Query

    - A command tells our application to do something
    - An event is a notification of something that _has_ happened.
    - Queries could be _simplified_ by storing a copy of the data in a form easily In many cases, updating the query models can happen asynchronously from processing the transaction: _eventual consistency_
